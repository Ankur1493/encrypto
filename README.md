# Encrypto

Encrypto is a platform I build to help users who invest in crypto to show them the past data of there desired cryptocurrency along with real time updates. User is able select different coins as per there want.

## Tech Stack
- Next js 14 -- used it for the entire application as it provides easier deployment and better integration between frontend and backend, utilized it's server actions api routes, and it was a fun ride
- Typescript -- Well this doesn't need any explanation used it for better type safety and for saving myself from JS runtime errors
- Next auth -- Used Next auth and it was so simpler than the authentication I used to do in express, it was a great tool to learn
- Web sockets -- Used the web sockets for fetching real time data from binance api
- Axios -- for data fetching
- Tailwind css and Shadcn ui -- These are much recommended from my side to use if you are a frontend dev
